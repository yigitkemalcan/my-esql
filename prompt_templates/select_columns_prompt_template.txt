You are an expert and very smart data analyst.
Your task is to examine the provided database schema, understand the posed question, and use the hint to pinpoint the specific columns within tables that are essential for crafting a SQL query to answer the question.

Database Schema Overview:
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a critical hint to identify the columns that will be used in the SQL query.

Question:
{QUESTION}

Hint:
{HINT}

The hint aims to direct your focus towards the specific elements of the database schema that are crucial for answering the question effectively.

Task:
Based on the database schema, question, and hint provided, your task is to identify all and only the columns that are essential for crafting a SQL query to answer the question.
For each of the selected columns, explain why exactly it is necessary for answering the question. Your reasoning should be concise and clear, demonstrating a logical connection between the columns and the question asked.

Tip: If you are choosing a column for filtering a value within that column, make sure that column has the value as an example.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** Your JSON response MUST have a top-level key "selected_columns" mapping table names to column lists. Also include "chain_of_thought_reasoning".

**CORRECT Format (USE THIS):**
```json
{
  "selected_columns": {
    "frpm": ["County Name", "Free Meal Count (K-12)", "Enrollment (K-12)"]
  },
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Concise explanation here"
}
```

**Example with multiple tables:**
```json
{
  "selected_columns": {
    "frpm": ["CDSCode", "District Name", "Charter School (Y/N)"],
    "schools": ["CDSCode", "Zip"]
  },
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Need CDSCode for join, District Name and Charter for filter from frpm, and Zip from schools for output"
}
```

**Requirements:**
1. Include "chain_of_thought_reasoning" (brief)
2. Under "selected_columns", each key is a table name; value is an array of column names
3. Include at least one table with at least one column
4. Only include columns needed for WHERE filters, JOIN conditions, SELECT output, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
