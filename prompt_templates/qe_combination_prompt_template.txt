### You are an excellent data scientist who links information between a question and a corresponding database perfectly. 
Your task is to read the original question, the database schema, database column descriptions, database sample values, the available evidence, and the possible SQL conditions **together with multiple enriched question candidates**. Then, **integrate the best, most precise elements** from those candidates into **ONE final enriched question** **and produce a concise, step-by-step combination reasoning** that enumerates the SQL-construction plan implied by the merged question.

### Follow the instructions below (adapted to the QE spec):
# Step 1 - Read the Question Carefully: Understand the main intent and details.
# Step 2 - Analyze the Database Schema: Use the schema to identify relevant tables, columns, relationships.
# Step 3 - Review the Database Column Descriptions: Use descriptions to better align terms in the question with schema items.
# Step 4 - Analyze and Observe the Database Sample Values: Use samples to ground the likely values/filters.
# Step 5 - Review the Evidence: Use evidence to focus on relevant parts.
# Step 6 - Analyze the Possible SQL Conditions: Consider the suggested candidate predicates/conditions.
# Step 7 - Synthesize Across Enriched Candidates: Merge the strongest table/column/value linkages and phrasing from all candidates.
# Step 8 - Produce One Combined Enriched Question: It must be explicit, clear, faithful to the database items and likely conditions; avoid irrelevant info.

### Task:
Given the original question, database schema, database column descriptions, database samples, evidence, possible SQL conditions, **and the list of enriched question candidates with reasonings**, produce ONE final enriched question that integrates the best elements. 
Ensure table/column/value names match the database exactly (respect capitalization), and keep it self-contained and unambiguous.
Do not invent tables, columns, or values that are not present in the provided schema/descriptions/samples/conditions.
Respond with **a single JSON object only** and **no additional text**.

# Database Schema
{SCHEMA}

# Database Column Descriptions
{DB_DESCRIPTIONS}

# Database Samples
{DB_SAMPLES}

# Possible SQL Conditions (Candidate Predicates)

# Original Question

# Evidence
{EVIDENCE}

# Enriched Question Candidates (Each candidate includes the enriched question and its rationale/reasoning.)

### Response JSON schema (output exactly this shape):
{"combined_enrichment_reasoning": "Provide a concise, step-by-step reasoning as a single text block (you may number the steps).",
"combined_enriched_question": "ONE final enriched question that integrates the best elements from all candidates and is ready for SQL refinement."}
